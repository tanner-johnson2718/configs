Welcome to the `mono` docs site! `mono` is my mono repo that houses all my 
code and personal project files. This
page is to be an index into all my documentation that **should** cover all
code, projects, and write ups.
  
**Directory Structure**
  
| Dir | Explaination |
| --- | ------------ |
| `docs`                | [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) base base dir |
| `esp32Modules`        | Self contained esp32 modules that can be composed to make systems. |
| `esp32Systems`        | Systems our projects that are flashed to a singular esp32. |
| [`homeModules`](#3-nixos-and-home-manager-modules)         | Home manage modules to imported from a `home.nix`. |
| [`nixosConfigurations`](#2-nixos-configurations) | NixOS modules that define a system. |
| [`nixosModules`](#3-nixos-and-home-manager-modules)        | NixOS modules to be composed and imported by a NixOS configuration. |
| [`packages`](#4-packages)            | Executables and Libraries that can be built independent of a system: `nix <build/run/develop> .#<pkg>` |
  
[Nix and NixOS](https://nixos.org/) will be the (meta) build system, packaging system, and the
system configuration tool used to give all my projects 1) a uniform experience and 2) provide the
plumbing and modularity for all my projects, all while maintaining bit level reproducibility.
