Welcome to the `env` docs site! `env` is the name of my mono repo that houses all my 
code and (personal) project files i.e. design docs, CAD files, notes, etc. This
page is to be an index into all my documentation that (**should**) cover all
code and projects in the `env` repo and will also contain some of my personal technical
writings.
