As a starting point, let us talk about this repo. The properties I am looking for can be divided 
into two categories. These are **Availability**: when, where, and how can this repo be 
accessed and **Durability**: mitigating risk of data loss. 
  
**Availability**:
  
* Every object in this repo will be scoped public.
* Availability even in WAN denied situations i.e. can be locally hosted and backed up
  to non local sources once connection is re-established.
* Public instance can be brought up, down, and moved seamlessly.
* Pushes are privileged and *only* my personal laptop ssh key is authorized.
* Down time is not really an issue.
 
 **Durability**
 
* AWS S3 bucket server backup.
* AWS EC2 server instance with copy on EBS.
* Local Qemu server instance.
* Local clones.
  
The above properties will be realized by a system the following architecture.
