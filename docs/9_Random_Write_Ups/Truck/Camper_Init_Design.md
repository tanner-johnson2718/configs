# Camper Init Design

The initial floor plan is something like the following:

![](./floor.svg)

* The 48" floor is the space between the wheel wells
* The rectangles opposite  the floor create the "wings" of the camper and will rest on the rails
* The bed rests on the rails creating a large storage space underneath the bed.
