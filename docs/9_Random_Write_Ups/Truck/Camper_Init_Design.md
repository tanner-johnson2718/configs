# Camper Init Design

Lets start with the mininum requirements:

* Bed space
* Heater - Will mount this underneath the truck on passenger side 
* Water System (Externally acessible)
* 12v Fridge / Freezer
* Desk
* Kitchen Area
* Propane (Externally acessible)

The initial floor plan is something like the following:

![](./floor.svg)

* The 48" floor is the space between the wheel wells
* The rectangles opposite  the floor create the "wings" of the camper and will rest on the rails
* The bed rests on the rails creating a large storage space underneath the bed.
    * Fridge
    * Maybe shoes
    * Maybe battery and electrical distribution?
    * Maybe just open Storage
* Can put the water system and propane in the kitchen/desk area "above the wing"
  under the main table / desk
    * Add a hatch on the outside to access water and propane.
* Kitchen/Desk area
    * Sink and cutting board under a "hard cover" that folds down and gives me a desk 
* Overhead storage
    * Half Hanger / Clothes
    * Other half cubbies
