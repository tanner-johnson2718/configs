# Camper Init Design

Lets start with the mininum requirements:

* Bed space
* Heater - Will mount this underneath the truck on passenger side 
* Water System (Externally acessible)
* 12v Fridge / Freezer
* Desk
* Kitchen Area
* Propane (Externally acessible)

## Floor Plan

The initial floor plan is something like the following:

![](./floor.svg)

| Parameter | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Width (Inner) | 76" | - |
| Floor Length (Inner) | 75" | May need to shrink this |
| Bed Length | 76" | Equal to "Width (Inner)" |
| Bed Width | 38" | Adjustable bet set to twin size |
| Floor Width | 48" | - |
| Wing Width | 14" | - |
| Overhead Storage Length | 24" | - |
| Desk Depth | 24" | - |

* The 48" floor is the space between the wheel wells
* The rectangles opposite  the floor create the "wings" of the camper and will rest on the rails
* The bed rests on the rails creating a large storage space underneath the bed.
    * Fridge
    * Maybe shoes
    * Maybe battery and electrical distribution?
    * Maybe just open Storage
* Can put the water system and propane in the kitchen/desk area "above the wing"
  under the main table / desk
    * Add a hatch on the outside to access water and propane.
* Kitchen/Desk area
    * Sink and cutting board under a "hard cover" that folds down and gives me a desk 
* Overhead storage
    * Half Hanger / Clothes
    * Other half cubbies

## Rear Profile

The floor plan gives us a good overview but lets look at the rear profile, this will
define our door / entrance and our roof profile:
